Tool for merging structural variants.

For now it is just a preliminary prototype and does not handle VCF input/output, or splitting variants by chromosome/type/strand.

The document describing the method can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UNYLisKn8OpPRdYGoxQMN174baGTaxsG5CuuR1QuCV0/edit?usp=sharing
